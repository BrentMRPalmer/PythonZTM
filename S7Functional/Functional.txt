Functional Programming

Functional programming is another paradigm (a way of thinking and organizing code).
Some of the concepts are different than OOP.
You don't necessarily need to use OOP or functional - you can use a hybrid.

What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming is about packaging our code into separate chunks. Each
part is organized based on functionality. Each part concerns itself with one
thing that it is good at. Data and functions are separate unlike in OOP. 
Generally, functional languages have an emphasis on simplicity of data 
and functions. Functions operate on well-defined data structures rather than
belonging that data structure to a class. 

The goals are:
1) Clear and understandable
2) Easy to extend
3) Easy to maintain
4) Memory efficient
5) DRY

Main pillar: pure functions
There is a separation between the data of a program
and the behaviour of a program.
