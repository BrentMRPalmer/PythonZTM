How Machine Learning Works

How do you teach a computer something like "what is a snake"?

With machine learning, you can teach a computer to roughly understand
what a snake is. 

In normal code we give the computer an input, and write a function, and 
the computer gives the output.

In machine learning, we give the input and the output, and then the 
machine determines the algorithm (function/model/bot/brain) to produce this. 

To train the machine, we need to give it lots and lots of data.
