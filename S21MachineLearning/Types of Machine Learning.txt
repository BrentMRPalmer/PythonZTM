Types of Machine Learning

What is machine learning?
We are able to use machines to predict results based on incoming data.

Here are three main categories:
1) Supervised: 
	The data that we receive already has categories. The 
	data is already labeled so we know if our function
	is right or wrong. We can do things like classification.
	We might do something called regression. 

2) Unsupervised:
	The data we receive does not have labels. Clustering can
	be used to create the groups/labels. The machine decides
	the groups. Association rule learning associates things 
	together based on high samples of inputs.

3) Reinforcement:
	All about teaching machines through trial and error, rewards
	and punishment. For example, teaching a game by doing it
	over and over again and being rewarded for good results.
	Considered skill acquisition and real time learning.
