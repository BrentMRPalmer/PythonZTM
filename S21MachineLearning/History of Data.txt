History of Data

Why do we need machine learning?

Think of a business: most innovations are for businesses.

Spreadsheets were originally used to store data and make analyzing 
data more efficient.

With more data, relational databases were created. Allows us to 
use a language (SQL) to read and write data to a database, and also
use the data from the business to make business decisions.

Then in the early 2000s the term "Big Data" became mainstream, with large
corporations having extremely large quantities of data. These companies
could not simply store all the data in spreadsheets. 
Sometimes the data was really unstructured and messy, so NoSQL and mongoDB 
were created for this type of data. 

Afterwards, Machine Learning has become relevant. Now we have so much
data that as humans we cannot look at it ourselves. We need to 
automate the process by using machines. The improvements of CPUs and GPUs
made machine learning possible.
